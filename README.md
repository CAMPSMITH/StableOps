# StableOps

**StableOps** is an analysis of potential opportunities derived from volatility in stablecoin pricing.  It was observed that many stablecoins have some volatility.  Although usually pegged to a FIAT currency, like the US dollar, they sometimes drift to be a little over or under that value.

#TODO: insert histogram and line chart of a stable coin

In theory, if this volatility could be harnessed, it might lead to 4-6% yield.  The objective of this project is to analyze volatility in stablecoin procing and assess whether this volatility could provide profitable arbitrage opportunities. 

The analysis contained in this project In order to explore this hypothesis further, the following will be analized:
* Analysis of the volatility of a sampling of stablecoins based on the US Dollar
    * frequency and magnitude of deviations from pegged stable value
* Analysis of the volatility of a sampling of stablecoins based on a currency other than the US Dollar
    * frequency and magnitude of deviations from pegged stable value
* Analysis of costs associated with exchanging stablecoins with FIAT currency or with another stablecoin
* Analysis of low risk yield producing options with stable coins, e.g. staking yields
    * Beta analysis ?
* Analysis of potential arbitrage opportunity
    * Simulation
