## Project Description / Outline
The objective of this project is to analyze volatility in stablecoin pricing and assess whether this volatility could provide profitable arbitrage opportunities.
Analysis will include: 
* volatility analysis of stablecoins
* costs associated with trading stablecoins
* risk / reward analysis of stablecoin arbitrage
* modeling and simulation of stablecoin arbitrage profitability projections

## Questions to Answer
* Can the volatility of stablecoin pricing yield sufficiently profitable arbitrage opportunities?
* Is the volatility of stablecoins pegged to the US Dollar similar or are some stablecoins more volatile than others?
* Is the volatility of stablecoins pegged to currencies other than the US Dollar similar to that of the ones pegged to the US Dollar or are they more volatile?
* Are the volatilities short lived or persistent?
* Are there any correlations between the volatility of various stablecoins?  
* Do some pairs yield better arbitrage opportunities?
* Are the risk, effort and costs associated with stablecoin arbitrage worth the potential reward?

## Datasets to be used
* Daily stablecoin pricing data spanning several years
* Intraday stablecoin pricing data, preferrably spanning 3 or more years
* Alpaca API for additional stablecoin pricing information

## Rough breackdown of tasks
* Research and identify a selection of stablecoins pegged to the US Dollar
* Research and identify a selection of stablecoins pegged to currencies other than the US Dollar
* Identify data sources for daily stablecoin pricing data, with 3-5 years of data
* Identify data sources for intraday stablecoin pricing data, preferably with 3+ years of data
* Research and summarize stablecoin trading costs
* Characterize and perform quantitative analysis of stablecoin volatility for selected stablecoins
* Create a model for stablecoin arbitrage.  Generate daily returns for arbitrage model.
* Risk/Reward (Sharpe Ratio) analysis of stablecoin arbitrage
* Montecarlo simulations to project future gains of stablecoin arbitrage
* Presentation preparation
* Project documentation
* Team formation / organization
