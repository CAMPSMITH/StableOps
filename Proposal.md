## Project Description / Outline
The objective of this project is to analyze volatility in stablecoin pricing and assess whether this volatility could provide profitable arbitrage opportunities.
Analysis will include: 

* volatility analysis of stablecoins
* cost analysis associated with trading stablecoins
* risk / reward analysis of stablecoin arbitrage
* simulation of stablecoin arbitrage profitability projections

## Questions to Answer
* Can the volatility of stablecoin pricing yield sufficiently profitable arbitrage opportunities?
* Is the volatility of stablecoins pegged to the US Dollar similar or are some stablecoins more volatile than others?
* Are the volatilities short lived or persistent?
* Are there any correlations between the volatility of various stablecoins?  
* Do some pairs yield better arbitrage opportunities?
* Are the risk, effort and costs associated with stablecoin arbitrage worth the potential reward?
